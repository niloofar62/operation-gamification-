# Queen of Housekeeping Challenge - Operation Gamification

**Overview**
This application simulates employee contests, particularly the Queen of Housekeeping Challenge. It is modeled after Kindra’s employee bulletin board for housekeepers, and would essentially serve as a digital bulletin board with pre - made designs that to be displayed via a tv or projector for employees. It currently features a page for admin and a page for game board. It is especially designed to help managers or administrators run employee contests at scale, specifically the Queen of Housekeeping Challenge.

**Admin Page :**
The admin page allows the manager or administrator to add employee names, survey scores, track department goals and employee averages, and create and update game rules. It allows them to track employee data, create and update game rules, and engage employees to drive participation and engagement. The application leverages Google Forms and Google Sheets as a backend storage solution and data validation is set up with Google Forms.

**Game Board (Display):**
The home gameboard displays the title of the challenge or game, each housekeeper's crown(s) with their name and jewel(s), and the rules of the game. The display page allows each employee to track their own place, and the current winner is displayed as the Queen.
